# DDPMSubtraction

This repository contains all the code to train a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate an image of a digit. Instead of naively generating a random digit, the model is trained to generate a digit that is the answer to a subtraction problem, which is represented by two images of digits being passed to it.
